# openCPN-ECDIS

this is dedicated to inlandECDIS: openCPN's sprite (rastersymbols-day.png) and lookup (chartsymbols.xml) do have some issues.

`rastersymbols.txt` and `rastersymbols.svg` is a comparison openCPN <> inlandECDIS_Presentation_Libraries.

`rastersymbols.svg` is derived from resources/openCPN_ECDIS/rastersymbols-day.png and chartsymbols-release.xml. File does have 3 layers
* 'original' (bitmap sprite)
* 'outline-vector' (names and bounding-boxes)
* 'symbols-vector' (annotations and svg-symbols)
